# learning_python
The following files are lab assignments as part of COSC1336 - Programming Fundamentals I

The textbook we are using is Tony Gaddis' "Starting Out With Python" 3rd ed.

Examples are original code written to put the lessons from the textbook into action, and initial commits represent
the work submitted as a homework assignment in unmodified states.

Subsequent commits are where later assignments called upon us to refactor the prior week's code with the new
information leanred, such as going from simple if-else statements to using while loops, to utilizing functions and
more.

No claims of functionality are being made.

Test the code at your own risk.

Do not copy this for your own assignment as much of the code here is broken, non-functional, and has been marked
down by the professor and corrected.

Corrected revisions being submitted are my own after further testing and not a result of professor comments or
corrections.

Thanks!
